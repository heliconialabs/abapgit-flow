When development is done, unit tested and reviewed, the next step is to deploy the changes to production.
This is done via the classic Change and Transport System (CTS).

Auditing via classic CTS

Pre-production environment

Heliconia Labs will provide more tooling in this area in the future

ATC/SCI to check eg. package structure

check branch is approved, up to date + ok status checks

release override feature

badi `CTS_REQUEST_CHECK`, `CHECK_BEFORE_RELEASE`

irreversible changes, eg. DDIC => abaplint.app feature / warning

=== Sequencing

txn `/SDF/TRCHECK`

finding possible sequence issues early => abaplint.app feature

feedback loop, if something fails late in the process, something early in the process should be fixed to catch it

=== Rollback

rollback feature
